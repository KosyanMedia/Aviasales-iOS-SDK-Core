## Example
As an example, you are welcome to use our Template Project from [Aviasales-iOS-SDK repo](https://github.com/KosyanMedia/Aviasales-iOS-SDK).

## ‚öô Installation
The easiest way is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). It takes care of all required frameworks and third party dependencies:

```ruby
pod 'AviasalesSDK', '~> 1.3.3-beta6'
```

We recommend to import ```AviasalesSDK.h``` in each file where you use objects or protocols from SDK.

```objc
#import <AviasalesSDK/AviasalesSDK.h>
```

Configure ```AviasalesSDK``` object before interaction with SDK like this:

```objc
AviasalesSDKInitialConfiguration *configuration = [AviasalesSDKInitialConfiguration configurationWithAPIToken:@"Your api token here"
                                                                                                    APILocale:[NSLocale currentLocale].localeIdentifier
                                                                                                partnerMarker:@"Your partner marker here"];
[AviasalesSDK setupWithConfiguration:configuration];
```
Don't forget to replace two placeholders in this example with the actual values.


## Features
### ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Tickets Search
Specify search parameters using any object that confirms to ```JRSDKSearchInfo``` protocol. Simple implementation of this protocol available in ```JRSDKConfigurableSearchInfo``` interface, but feel free to create your own if needed. Look at the example below.

#### Create search info
Create simple object that describes new search:

```objc
JRSDKConfigurableSearchInfo *searchInfo = [[JRSDKConfigurableSearchInfo alloc] init];
```
Set necessary parameters for the search (*adults = 2* and *travelClass = Business* means that two adults would like to travel in business class):

```objc
searchInfo.adults = 2;
searchInfo.travelClass = JRSDKTravelClassBusiness;
```
Set travel dates and airports (using airports storage from the SDK):

```objc
JRSDKConfigurableTravelSegment *firstTravelSegment = [[JRSDKConfigurableTravelSegment alloc] init];
firstTravelSegment.departureDate = [NSDate date];
firstTravelSegment.originAirport = [[AviasalesSDK sharedInstance].airportsStorage findAnythingByIATA:@"LED"];
firstTravelSegment.destinationAirport = [[AviasalesSDK sharedInstance].airportsStorage findAnythingByIATA:@"MOW"];
```
Save that travel segment to the search info:

```objc
searchInfo.travelSegments = [NSOrderedSet orderedSetWithObject:firstTravelSegment];
```
That's it. Search info is ready for search.

####Perform search request
To perform search request use ```SearchPerformer``` received from the SDK and send search info to it. **Don't forget to store** this performer somewhere during the search process.

```objc
JRSDKSearchPerformer *searchPerformer = [[AviasalesSDK sharedInstance] createSearchPerformer];
```
To retrieve live and final search results set delegate (```JRSDKSearchPerformerDelegate```) to this search performer:

```objc
searchPerformer.delegate = self;
```
This delegate requires to implement three methods:
first one needed to receive live search results

```objc
- (void)searchPerformer:(JRSDKSearchPerformer *)searchPerformer didFinishRegularSearch:(id<JRSDKSearchInfo>)searchInfo withResult:(id<JRSDKSearchResult>)result;
```
Second needed to receive error if it occures during the search

```objc
- (void)searchPerformer:(JRSDKSearchPerformer *)searchPerformer didFailSearchWithError:(NSError *)error connection:(JRServerAPIConnection *)connection;
```
And the third one needed to understand when the process is finished. After its call, you can release search performer because it is not recyclable.

```objc
- (void)searchPerformer:(JRSDKSearchPerformer *)searchPerformer didFinalizeSearchWithInfo:(id<JRSDKSearchInfo>)searchInfo error:(NSError *)error;
```
Start search performing:

```objc
[searchPerformer performSearchWithSearchInfo:searchInfo
                             includeResultsInEnglish:YES];
```

####Parsing search result
Search result is provided with ```id<JRSDKSearchResult>``` object.

Property                  | Description
:------------------------ | :------------------------
```searchID```            | this parameter is necessary in [purchase process](#ticket-purchase-anchor)
```strictSearchTickets``` | tickets that found exactly between requested airports
```searchTickets```       | tickets that found between cities (metropolitan areas) that is near to requested airports

### <a name="ticket-purchase-anchor"></a>üí∏ Tickets purchase
```AviasalesSDKPurchasePerformer``` is object used to perform ticket purchase. Each ticket contains different prices, you should use one of them as an input parameter.
Create performer using price and searchId that was returned with the search result.

```objc
- (instancetype)initWithPrice:(id <JRSDKPrice>)price
                     searchId:(NSString *)searchId;
```
and start purchase using a method

```objc
- (void)performWithDelegate:(id <AviasalesSDKPurchasePerformerDelegate>)delegate;
```
Open link received by delegate in browser to provide user purchase form.

### üì∫ Advertisement
Aviasales SDK allows you to generate additional revenue by displaying advertisements to your users.
Use ```AviasalesSDKAdsManager``` object received like:

```objc
[AviasalesSDK sharedInstance].adsManager
```
to load information for the waiting screen 

```objc 
- (void)loadAdsViewForWaitingScreenWithSearchInfo:(id <JRSDKSearchInfo>)searchInfo completion:(AviasalesSDKAdsManagerCompletion)completion;
```
or for the search results list with your search info.

```objc
- (void)loadAdsViewForSearchResultsWithSearchInfo:(id <JRSDKSearchInfo>)searchInfo completion:(AviasalesSDKAdsManagerCompletion)completion;
```
After appropriate method call you will receive ```AviasalesSDKAdsView``` with ads.

## ‚öí Other Utils by SDK
Name | How to retrieve object | Description
-----|-----------------------|------------
Airports storage|```[AviasalesSDK sharedInstance].airportsStorage```|Finds airport by IATA, provides a list of airports
```AviasalesAirportsSearchPerformer```| ```[[AviasalesAirportsSearchPerformer alloc] init]```|Finds airports by string
```AviasalesNearestAirportsManager```|```[AviasalesSDK sharedInstance].nearestAirportsManager```|Finds nearest airports to the current user.
```AviasalesSDKAdsManager```|```[AviasalesSDK sharedInstance].adsManager```| Loads and displays advertisement according to search parameters
```JRSDKModelUtils```| ```[JRSDKModelUtils <method name here>]```|Util methods that help you to work with SDK objects
